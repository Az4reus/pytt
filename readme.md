# Pytt
_(read: Pit)_

Really simple, project based CLI todo list. Nothing fancy, nothing groundbreaking.
Just something to fill my needs without needing the laborious implementation that 
is Taskwarrior. 

_No really, if you need more features, use Taskwarrior._ 

_Actually, you should probably use Taskwarrior regardless. That thing is pretty
damn good._
